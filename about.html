  <h1>Jeremiah's 3 Facts</h1>
  <p>My name is Jeremiah Hoof and I am 26 years old.</p>
  <p>My career aspirations are to become a mainstream singer/songwriter, actor, and to become apart of an Indie or an AAA studio team. </p>
  <p>My favorite foods are Pepperoni & Banana Pepper pizza, homemade salmon and chicken alfredo (albeit Chili's recipe has me beat at the moment), and any form of potato (fried, baked, mashed, etc.)  </p>
